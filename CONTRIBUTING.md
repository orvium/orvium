## Code of Conduct

Orvium's Code of Conduct means that you are responsible for treating everyone on the project with respect and courtesy regardless of their identity. If you are the victim of any inappropriate behavior or comments as described in our Code of Conduct, we are here for you and will do the best to ensure that the abuser is reprimanded appropriately, per our code. Please [read the full code of conduct] so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Development Process

We utilize GitHub to host our codebase, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Using GitHub Flow

We follow [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), so all code changes are made through pull requests. Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`.
2. **Add tests** for any new code you write, if applicable.
3. **Update documentation** if required, especially important for changes in the APIs.
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before you commit your code.
5. **Check code style** with linting tools (e.g., `npm run lint`).
6. **Submit a pull request** with your changes.

## Reporting Bugs

Report bugs through GitHub issues by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourproject/yourproject/issues/new). We appreciate detailed and well-documented bug reports. Here's how to write one:

- Provide a **clear summary** and/or background.
- Include **steps to reproduce** the issue:
  - Be specific and provide sample code if possible, using tools like [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) to share snippets.
- Explain **what you expected to happen** and **what actually happened**.
- Include any additional notes, such as potential causes or solutions you've tried.

A great bug report example can be found in this [well-structured report by briandk](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) or [this example by Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

## Coding Style

To maintain consistency in our codebase, please adhere to the following style guidelines:

- Use **2 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).
- Run `npm run lint` to check and fix any style issues.
